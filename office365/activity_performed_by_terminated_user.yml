  description: Detects when a Microsoft Cloud App Security reported for users whose
    account were terminated in Azure AD, but still perform activities in other platforms
    such as AWS or Salesforce. This is especially relevant for users who use another
    account to manage resources, since these accounts are often not terminated when
    a user leaves the company.
