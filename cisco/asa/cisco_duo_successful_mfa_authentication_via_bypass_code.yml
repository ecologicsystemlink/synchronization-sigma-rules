  description: Detects when a successful MFA authentication occurs due to the use
    of a bypass code. A bypass code is a temporary passcode created by an administrator
    for a specific user to access a Duo-protected application. These are generally
    used as "backup codes," so that enrolled users who are having problems with their
    mobile devices (e.g., mobile service is disrupted, the device is lost or stolen,
    etc.) or who temporarily can't use their enrolled devices (on a plane without
    mobile data services) can still access their Duo-protected systems.
