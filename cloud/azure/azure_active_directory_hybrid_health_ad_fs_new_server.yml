  description: This detection uses azureactivity logs (Administrative category) to
    identify the creation or update of a server instance in an Azure AD Hybrid health
    AD FS service. A threat actor can create a new AD Health ADFS service and create
    a fake server instance to spoof AD FS signing logs. There is no need to compromise
    an on-prem AD FS server. This can be done programmatically via HTTP requests to
    Azure.
