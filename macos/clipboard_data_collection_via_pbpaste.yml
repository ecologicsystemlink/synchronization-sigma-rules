  description: Detects execution of the "pbpaste" utility, which retrieves the contents
    of the clipboard (a.k.a. pasteboard) and writes them to the standard output (stdout).
    The utility is often used for creating new files with the clipboard content or
    for piping clipboard contents to other commands. It can also be used in shell
    scripts that may require clipboard content as input. Attackers can abuse this
    utility in order to collect data from the user clipboard, which may contain passwords
    or sensitive information. Use this rule to hunt for potential abuse of the utility
    by looking at the parent process and any potentially suspicious command line content.
